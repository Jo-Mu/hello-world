Tutorial time my dudes!

Hiya folks,

Names Jo-Mu (<= literally the first 2 letters of my first and last name but hey it rolls off the tongue pretty well) and I'm looking to get into programming. I graduated with a Bio degree which hasn't panned out well in terms of job prospects so I made a decision to take action and get more into programming which I did a lot both as a hobby and during college helping friends with projects and I personally enjoyed it a lot. I am committed to learn as much as I can, work on projects (actually put them on GitHub this time), and turn my life around. Wish me luck and I hope to get to know a lot of you here.
